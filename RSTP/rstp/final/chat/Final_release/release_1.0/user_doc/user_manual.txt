First, flash the rootfs file from SD card to NAND flash.

Then the board will fully boot.

If sometimes the PHY is not detected, reboot the board, remove the TTL, power off, power on, then connect the TTL.

Automatic login and module installation will run, and the client app will start automatically.

On the board, the user needs to set the device name and IP address in /home/root.

You can run the one_time_setup.sh script one time as follows:

./onetime_setup.sh 'am437x' '192.168.0.xxx'

Each board will have a different name and IP.

On the server, you need to edit the client_information.txt file.

For example, the content should look like this:

am43761 192.168.0.200
am43762 192.168.0.100

Then just run the ./server.
